    <div class="mainText">Hi, I’m Dejan. I'm a multi-talented human with over 10+ years of experiences in wide range of design disciplines.
    </p>
    <p>
You can also call me a product designer, experience designer, interaction, UI, UX or by any other market defined function-title. I'm also a multi-disciplinary maker with over 10 years of experiences in wide range of design disciplines, manager, advisor, entrepreneur, front-end developer, music enthusiast, traveler, photographer and more.
    </p>
    <p>
I don’t like to define myself by the work I’ve done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
    </p>
    <p>
Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I’m easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I’m passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. I’m never satisfied to just come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.
    </p>
    <p>
My abundant energy fuels me in the pursuit of many interests, hobbies, areas of study and artistic endeavors. I’m a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.
    </p>
    <p>
I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career. My personality type is <a class="underline text-color-white" href="http://www.personalitypage.com/ENTJ.html" target="_blank"> ENTJ</a>. I currently work remotely with a selected freelance client base and are open for new opportunities.
